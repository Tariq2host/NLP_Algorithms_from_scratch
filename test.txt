**The Lost Key**  
Once upon a time, Anna misplaced her key. She searched under the couch, inside her bag, and even in the fridge, but it was nowhere to be found. Frustrated, she sat down to think. Suddenly, she remembered playing with her cat, Whiskers, earlier that morning. Could Whiskers have taken the key? Anna followed her cat to the living room, where she found the key hidden beneath a pile of cushions. Relieved, she laughed and thanked Whiskers for the unexpected adventure.
