# NLP Challenges and Solutions

This repository contains various challenges and their corresponding solutions related to natural language processing (NLP). Each challenge is designed to test and demonstrate different aspects of NLP, from basic text cleaning and tokenization to more advanced tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentiment Analysis. Below is a list of challenges, along with their descriptions and the corresponding solutions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Word Frequency Counter üìä**
   - **Challenge**: Write a Python function that takes a text document as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the document.
   - **Solution**: The solution demonstrates how to count word frequencies in a text document and return the results in a dictionary format.
   - **Solution file**: `word_frequency_counter`

### 2. **Text Cleaning and Tokenization üßπ**
   - **Challenge**: Create a function to clean and tokenize a given text, removing punctuation and converting words to lowercase.
   - **Solution**: This solution provides a clean and efficient way to preprocess text by removing unwanted characters and splitting it into tokens.
   - **Solution file**: `text_cleaning_and_tokenization`

### 3. **Stopword Removal üö´**
   - **Challenge**: Develop a function that removes stopwords (commonly used words like 'the', 'a', 'in') from a given sentence or text.
   - **Solution**: This function filters out stopwords from a text using a predefined stopwords list, improving the quality of text for further analysis.
   - **Solution file**: `stopword_removal`

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis üåü**
   - **Challenge**: Build a sentiment analysis classifier that predicts whether a given text has positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
   - **Solution**: The solution includes a machine learning-based model that classifies text into sentiment categories.
   - **Solution file**: `sentiment_analysis`

### 5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) üßê**
   - **Challenge**: Implement a Named Entity Recognition algorithm that identifies and classifies named entities like names, locations, and organizations in a text.
   - **Solution**: This solution leverages NLP techniques to identify and categorize entities within a given text.
   - **Solution file**: `named_entity_recognition`

### 6. **Text Similarity üìú**
   - **Challenge**: Create a function that measures the similarity between two text documents using techniques like TF-IDF or cosine similarity.
   - **Solution**: This function compares two documents and returns a similarity score based on vector space models.
   - **Solution file**: `text_similarity`

### 7. **Topic Modeling üìå**
   - **Challenge**: Use techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform topic modeling on a collection of documents.
   - **Solution**: The solution demonstrates how to apply LDA to uncover latent topics in a corpus of documents.
   - **Solution file**: `topic_modeling`

### 8. **Text Generation üñãÔ∏è**
   - **Challenge**: Build a text generation model (e.g., using Markov Chains or RNNs) that generates coherent sentences based on a given input.
   - **Solution**: This solution builds a model capable of generating new text based on patterns learned from a corpus.
   - **Solution file**: `text_generation`

### 9. **Named Entity Linking (NEL) üåê**
   - **Challenge**: Extend NER by linking named entities to their corresponding real-world entities (e.g., linking ‚ÄúApple‚Äù to the company).
   - **Solution**: This solution performs entity linking, identifying real-world references to named entities.
   - **Solution file**: `named_entity_linking`

### 10. **POS Tagging üìù**
   - **Challenge**: Develop a part-of-speech tagging algorithm that assigns grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb) to each word in a sentence.
   - **Solution**: This solution provides part-of-speech tagging for a given sentence using NLP libraries and algorithms.
   - **Solution file**: `pos_tagging`
