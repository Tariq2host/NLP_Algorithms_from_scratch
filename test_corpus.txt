The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
All that glitters is not gold.
Better late than never.
Actions speak louder than words.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
The early bird catches the worm.
This too shall pass.
